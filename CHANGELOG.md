# Change Log

All notable changes to the "horizon-extended" extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0]

I think about time to make this thing official as 1.0.0.

- Added a new dark theme variant, "neo", which uses minimal borders to separate elements rather than different background colors. This also has a more consistent color palette throughout the theme.
- Modified the light theme to be closer to the Nvim theme which is easier on the eyes.
- Preserved original themes as "original".

## [0.2.0]

- Added a new dark theme variant which removes the italics from the editor. This is in response to issue #8.
- Slightly modified the selection colors to make selections more visible.
- Added `string.unquoted` to the list of scopes that are colored green in the dark themes.

- Fixed the ignored git file foreground color so they are actually visible. Response to issue #4.
